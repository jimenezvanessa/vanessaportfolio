PRD: Local Data-Driven Portfolio & Activity Log
1. Project Overview
Goal: Build a high-performance, SEO-optimized portfolio using Next.js that renders content from local data structures (JSON/Markdown).
Objective: To consolidate all internship activities into a single "Lego-style" codebase that demonstrates technical proficiency and SOLID principles.
2. Technical Stack
Framework: Next.js (App Router).
Language: TypeScript (Strict mode).
Styling: Tailwind CSS.
Data Handling: Local JSON for projects and MDX or Markdown for logs/blogs.
Deployment: Vercel or Netlify.

3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Data Architecture
projects.json: Must include Title, Description, Tech Stack (array), Completion Date, and Category (e.g., "SEO Audit," "Frontend," "Research").
Markdown Content: Weekly learning logs or technical documentation stored in /content and parsed dynamically.
Type Safety: All data must be mapped to specific TypeScript Interfaces to ensure no missing properties.
3.2 Core Pages & Navigation
Home (/): Hero section + "Featured" highlights + Live Internship Timeline.
Work (/work): A gallery of all activities with a Filter System (filter by tech stack or category).
Logs (/logs/[slug]): Dynamic routes generated via generateStaticParams for reading weekly internship logs.
3.3 Component Architecture ("Lego-Style")
Atomic Design: Break UI into atoms (Buttons, Badges) and molecules (ProjectCards, NavLinks).
Layouts: Persistent navigation and footer with active-link styling.
Loading States: Implementation of loading.tsx skeletons for transitions.

4. Non-Functional Requirements
4.1 Performance & SEO
Lighthouse Score: 90+ in Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO.
Image Optimization: Every image must use the Next.js <Image/> component with specific width/height or fill to prevent layout shifts.
Metadata API: Implementation of dynamic generateMetadata for the log pages to ensure unique SEO titles.
4.2 Mobile Responsiveness
Fluid Grids: Use Tailwind's grid/flex system to transition from 1 column (mobile) to 3 columns (desktop).
Touch-Ready: Minimum 44x44px hit targets for all interactive buttons and links.
Performance: No layout shifts (CLS) on mobile devices.

5. Project Milestones (Phasing)

Milestone
Deliverables
1
Data & Schema
Create projects.json and basic Markdown logs; define TS Interfaces.
2
Base Architecture
Set up Next.js App Router, Tailwind, and Global Layout.
3
Dynamic Routing
Implement file-system reading logic to generate /logs/[slug] pages.
4
UI/UX Development
Build the Filterable Work Gallery and Responsive Navigation.
5
Optimization
Audit via Lighthouse; compress images; add Meta Tags.
6
Deployment
Host on Vercel and submit the live link for final review.


6. Success Criteria
New projects can be added simply by editing the JSON file without touching the UI code.
The site is fully accessible (screen reader friendly).
The code follows SOLID principles (e.g., the Filter logic is separate from the UI display).
